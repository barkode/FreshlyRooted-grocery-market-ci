## Agile Methodology

### Overview

Agile methodology is a project management approach centered on adaptability, collaboration, and consistent progress
toward well-defined goals. It’s particularly effective in software development, where requirements and solutions evolve
through the combined efforts of self-organizing, cross-functional teams. Agile emphasizes delivering frequent,
incremental updates that improve quality and enable rapid response to changing needs.

## Agile Methodology

### Overview

Agile methodology is a project management approach centered on adaptability, collaboration, and consistent progress
toward well-defined goals. Itâ€™s particularly effective in software development, where requirements and solutions evolve
through the combined efforts of self-organizing, cross-functional teams. Agile emphasizes delivering frequent,
incremental updates that improve quality and enable rapid response to changing needs.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

The MoSCoW prioritization technique is a framework used to evaluate the importance of various project features and
tasks. It organizes items into four categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This method supports
efficient time management by ensuring that the most critical features are prioritized and completed before others.

### GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects offers a structured approach to task management and progress tracking through project boards. Each board
represents an EPIC, with columns reflecting task statuses like To Do, In Progress, On Hold, Done, and Bugs. Tasks are
systematically organized using labels to indicate the assigned user, priority level, and associated sprint, enabling
efficient team collaboration and streamlined project oversight.

## Wireframes

The platform's wireframes offer a visual blueprint of the application's layout and structure, detailing the positioning
of essential elements like navigation menus, user profiles, content sections, and interactive features. They serve as a
foundation for creating a cohesive and user-friendly interface, guiding both the design and development stages.
Following thorough testing, some adjustments were made, resulting in minor deviations from the initial wireframes in the
live version of the platform to enhance usability and functionality.

### AWS Cloud Service

To integrate AWS, follow steps:

#### Create and Configure an S3 Bucket

1. **Access AWS:**

    - Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and log in to your AWS Management Console.

2. **Create an S3 Bucket:**

    - Search for "S3" in the AWS Management Console and create a new bucket.
    - Name the bucket to match your Heroku app name and select the region closest to your target audience.

3. **Set Public Access and Ownership:**

    - Uncheck the "Block all public access" option and acknowledge that the bucket will be public (required for
      compatibility with Heroku).
    - Under "Object Ownership," ensure "ACLs enabled" and "Bucket owner preferred" are selected.

4. **Enable Static Website Hosting:**

    - In the "Properties" tab, enable static website hosting.
    - Set `index.html` as the index document and `error.html` as the error document, then click "Save."

5. **Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**

    - In the "Permissions" tab, add the following CORS configuration:

   ```json
   [
     {
        "AllowedHeaders": ["Authorization"],
        "AllowedMethods": ["GET"],
        "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
     }
   ]
    ```

- Copy your bucket's **ARN** (Amazon Resource Name).


6. **Add a Bucket Policy:**

    - Go to the "Bucket Policy" tab and click on the "Policy Generator" link.
    - Configure the policy:
        - **Policy Type:** S3 Bucket Policy
        - **Effect:** Allow
        - **Principal:** \*
        - **Actions:** `s3:GetObject`
        - **ARN:** Paste your bucket's ARN
    - Click "Add Statement" and "Generate Policy."
    - Copy the generated policy and paste it into the "Bucket Policy Editor":

   ``` json 
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
       }
     ]
   }
    ```

- Ensure the `Resource` field ends with `/*` and click "Save."


7. **Adjust Access Control List (ACL):**

    - In the "Access Control List" (ACL) section, click "Edit" and enable "List" for Everyone (public access). Accept
      the warning prompt.
    - If the edit option is disabled, ensure the "Object Ownership" settings have ACLs enabled.

[Back to top](#contents)

    - In the "JSON" tab, click "Import Managed Policy" and search for `AmazonS3FullAccess`.
    - Import the policy and modify it to limit access to your specific bucket:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:*",
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
           "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
    ```

- Click "Review Policy" and name it (e.g., `your-policy`), then click "Create Policy."

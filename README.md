## Agile Methodology

### Overview

Agile methodology is a project management approach centered on adaptability, collaboration, and consistent progress
toward well-defined goals. It’s particularly effective in software development, where requirements and solutions evolve
through the combined efforts of self-organizing, cross-functional teams. Agile emphasizes delivering frequent,
incremental updates that improve quality and enable rapid response to changing needs.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

The MoSCoW prioritization technique is a framework used to evaluate the importance of various project features and
tasks. It organizes items into four categories: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This method supports
efficient time management by ensuring that the most critical features are prioritized and completed before others.

### GitHub Projects

GitHub Projects offers a structured approach to task management and progress tracking through project boards. Each board
represents an EPIC, with columns reflecting task statuses like To Do, In Progress, On Hold, Done, and Bugs. Tasks are
systematically organized using labels to indicate the assigned user, priority level, and associated sprint, enabling
efficient team collaboration and streamlined project oversight.

        "description": "Altrient C Liposomal Vitamin C 30 Sachets\r\nMost ordinary forms of oral Vitamin C – tablets, capsules, powders, liquids and even dietary sources are not metabolised efficiently due to tightly regulated absorption controls in the body. This means that levels of vitamin C in the intestines reaches saturation point at as little as 200mg. In fact, the more we take in the less we absorb. Thus, very little reaches your blood stream let alone the cells where it is needed most.\r\n\r\nUntil recently intravenous delivery of vitamin C has proven to be the most effective route for absorption, but this method is both costly and impractical. Altrient C offers the perfect solution because of its scientifically proven liposomal delivery method. This powerful form of transportation encapsulates the nutrient in a microscopic phospholipid bubble that carries it within minutes directly to the cells, protecting it from the destructive elements of the digestive system. Altrient C is the most effective option for ensuring your body has adequate vitamin C levels.\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections\r\nTake 1-2 sachets a day\r\nDoes not dissolve in liquid\r\nDo not blend, process or put in hot water\r\nSqueeze sachet into a shot glass amount of water or juice\r\nBest taken on an empty stomach to speed up the absorption\r\nIt can be folded gently into a yoghurt\r\n\r\nAltrient C Nutritional Facts: 1 Sachet (5.7 mL) 30 Sachet's Per Box\r\nAmount Per Sachet % NRV*\r\nVitamin C (as sodium ascorbate) 1,000 mg 1,250%\r\nPhospholipids (from soy lecithin) 1,000 mg †\r\nof which phosphatidylcholine 500 mg †\r\n*Nutritional Reference Value †NRV not established\r\n\r\nIngredients\r\nDeionized Water, Sodium Ascorbate, Lecithin Phospholipids (Soy), Alcohol (ethanol), Citric Acid (for pH adjustment).\r\n\r\n\r\nFree From GMO ingredients, sugar, wheat, gluten, yeast, dairy, meat products, hexane, soy protein, artificial colours and flavours.
